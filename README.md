If you want to keep your web browsing private, you can use the Incognito mode in Chrome, Private Browsing in Firefox, In Private mode in Microsoft Edge, and so on. While this will prevent other people who use your computer from seeing your browsing history, it doesn't prevent your ISP from monitoring the sites you are visiting. You might well want to – for any number of reasons – browse the internet completely anonymously, and this is precisely what the Tor Browser offers.
Standing for The Onion Router, Tor offers multiple levels of protection to ensure that your online activities, location and identity are kept entirely private.

Tor is designed to give all of the users the same identity. It's as if all of the people are wearing the same masks. It is the best tool to stay anonymous. Tor hides the location, relaying the traffic through three random places in the world and encrypting the traffic with a triple layer of encryption to be sure nobody has access to the tor circuit back to its origin.

Tor isn't meant to fully remove tracking; rather, it's meant to make it more difficult for websites to trace a user's actions and data back to them. Data in tor cannot be meaningfully deciphered and utilized for some purposes, so we can consider it as a secure way for generating data.

## History

The Tor Project is a non-profit organization that currently develops and maintains the Tor, while funding is often provided by the US, Sweden and some other sponsors. Tor is based on the idea of Onion Routing, developed by Paul Syverson, Micheal G Reed and David Goldschlag in US Naval Laboratories in the 1990s.The alpha version of The Onion Router, or TOR for short, was developed by Roger Dingledin and Nick Mathewson and released on September 20, 2002. Needless to say, the project continues to be funded by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, or EFF for short. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(network))

### Global usage of TOR browser

## How to install and use TOR

 1. install and configure Tor Browser. Start by downloading and installing Tor Browser.
2.  Get online with Tor.
3.  Choose your security level.
4.  Rethink your browsing habits.
5.  Understand Tor circuits.
6.  Create a new identity.
7. Use HTTPS.
8.  Access.

### Some important tips to use TOR

 - Change the security level
 There are 3 security mode: Standard, Safer, Safest. by default it is set to Standard, but it is recommended to change it to safer or safest mode to disable Javascript. 
 -  Use noscript extention
 It helps you to choose what Javascript code is allowed to run manually. For each script to be run you need to move it to the trusted.
 You can add the noscript icon from customize in the main menu. 
 - Refresh the browser using brush icon
 Refreshing will clear all the browser data including history, cookies and cash without restarting the browser.
  - Use HTTPS everywhere add-in
  This will force every website you visit to use encrypted connection HTTPS instead of non-secure HTTP protocol.
  - Do not use personal accounts
  if you wat to stay anonymous, do not use any account that contain your name, number, E-mail or any other personal information.
  - Do not change any setting, install add-ins or plugins
  - Never go full-screen resolution
  It can identify your device
  - Do not disclose any personal information
  Information likes location, hobbies, pets name, screenshots and etc.
  - Use end-to-end encryption

## How TOR works?
![enter image description here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/How_Tor_Works_2.svg/1410px-How_Tor_Works_2.svg.png)
This figure shows the implementation of onion routing, which encrypts and then randomly bounces communications through a network of relays run by volunteers around the globe. These onion routers employ encryption in a multi-layered manner (hence the onion metaphor) to ensure perfect forward secrecy between relays, thereby providing users with anonymity in a network location. In this figure, Alice’s tor client uses three random places, relay the traffic and encrypt the traffic with a triple layer of encryption to be sure nobody has access to the tor circuit back to its origin.

## Dark web

The term dark web first emerged in 2009; but, it is not known when the actual dark web first emerged. The dark web forms a small part of the deep web, but requires custom software in order to access its content. The deep web is broadly defined as anything that is not indexed by traditional search engines. Dark web or darknet websites can be accessed through Tor browser. Tor browsers provide users with encrypted entry points and pathways to the dark web, allowing them to remain anonymous in their searches and actions, hence, identities and locations of darknet users stay anonymous and cannot be tracked due to the layered encryption system.

Users' data is routed through a large number of intermediate servers using darknet encryption technology, which conceals users' identities and ensures anonymity. The transmitted information can be decrypted only by a subsequent node in the scheme, which leads to the exit node. The complicated system makes it almost impossible to reproduce the node path and decrypt the information layer by layer.[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_web).

###  The Good, The Bad and The Ugly

Unsurprisingly, the deep web is also home to criminality – but so too is the clear web. The dark web does not monopolize cybercrime. While the dark web is home to lots of crime, it also hosts many legitimate companies like New York Times and Facebook who offer Tor-based services, as well as generally benign content. The dark web is not equivalent to cybercrime.[source](https://www.digitalshadows.com/blog-and-research/dark-web-monitoring-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/).

On its good side, the dark web enables the communication of human rights activists and whistle-blowers around the world (it has facilitated freedom of expression in Iran and Egypt, and it has been used by Wikileaks and Edward Snowden, as well as by journalists and even officials). [source](https://www.diplomacy.edu/blog/dark-web-good-bad-and-ugly/).

Many journalists, alternative news organizations, academics, and scholars have influenced the public's understanding of the darknet through their writing and speaking about it.

Media coverage typically reports on the dark web in two ways; detailing the power and freedom of speech the dark web allows people to express, or more commonly reaffirms the illegality and fear of its contents, such as computer hackers. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_web).

On the other hand, the dark web also hosts markets of illegal goods (such as counterfeit products, drugs, and IDs) and financial crime services (such as money laundering and bank frauds).

In addition, crypto-currencies like BitCoin (a decentralized peer-to-peer electronic system of payment), which have great potential for global markets, at the same time enable criminals to transfer money while avoiding the centralized banking system. Each step in a regular crime market between a seller and a buyer (communications and transactions, trust, payment and money flow, and logistics) can be anonymised, which makes it a hard task for law enforcement agencies (LEA) to combat dark markets.

There is an ugly side to it as well: markets offering paedophilia content, hitman services, conventional and chemical weapons purchase, and illegal medical research.[source](https://www.diplomacy.edu/blog/dark-web-good-bad-and-ugly/).

Breaches such as selling personal information and online credentials such as emails, IDs and passwords have lately become popular on the dark web. For example, a recent breach was about a hacker claimed to be selling millions of Twitter accounts. A Russian seller goes by the name Tessa88, claimed to have obtained the database, which includes email addresses (sometimes two per individual), usernames, and plain-text passwords, in an encrypted chat on Tuesday and selled the cache for 10 bitcoins, or about $5,820 at the time of writing.

## Hidden Wiki
One of the best websites that is a good resource for both beginner and experienced users is Wiki Hidden. When buying from the Dark Web, we should only use encrypted money (digital currency). Most sellers on the Dark Web accept payment by credit card, but the buyer should never use a credit card or any other method. Instead of using bitcoin, it is recommended using digital currencies that are more privately secured. Some of the encrypted money used for the dark web which are safer than bitcoin are Zcash and Monero.[The hidden wiki](https://thehiddenwiki.org/).
